# Mnemonic Build Journal

## Week 1: Foundation - Semantic Search

### Day 1 (Oct 15, 2024)
✅ Repository created and pushed to GitHub  
✅ Python environment setup  
✅ Initial project structure  
✅ README with project vision  

**Feeling:** Nervous but committed. This is real now.

### Day 2 (Oct 16, 2024)
✅ Built SimpleMemory class  
✅ JSON persistence working  
✅ Store/retrieve/search functionality  
✅ 60 lines of clean Python  

**Learning:** Keeping it simple first was the right call. Tempted to over-engineer but resisted.

### Day 3 (Oct 16, 2024)
✅ CLI interface complete  
✅ 4 commands working (store/search/list/stats)  
✅ Actually using it to track this journey  
✅ First 3 commits in 3 days  

**Milestone:** I have a working product. It's basic, but it WORKS.

**Next:** Add semantic search with ChromaDB. Time to make it actually intelligent.
