# Mnemonic: A Personal AI Memory System

Building an AI that actually remembers you.

## The Problem
Current AI assistants have amnesia. Every conversation starts from zero. 
Mnemonic changes that.

## What I'm Building
A local-first, personal AI context engine that:
- Remembers every interaction
- Learns your patterns and preferences
- Connects knowledge across conversations
- Runs on your machine (privacy-first)
- Gets smarter over time


**Status:** Week 1 - Foundation

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- ChromaDB (vector storage)
- SQLite (graph relationships)
- [More as I build]
