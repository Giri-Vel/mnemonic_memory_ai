# Mnemonic: 6-Month Master Roadmap

**Project:** Personal AI Memory System  
**Timeline:** October 2024 - April 2025  
**Goal:** Build a production-grade memory system + land 250k USD remote job  
**Deadline:** June 2025 (wedding)

---

## Mission Statement

Build an AI that actually remembers you. A local-first, personal context engine that learns from every interaction and gets smarter over time.

## The Big Picture

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-6):** Foundation - Core memory infrastructure  
**Phase 2 (Weeks 7-12):** Intelligence - Make it learn and reason  
**Phase 3 (Weeks 13-18):** Interface - Make it usable as an agent  
**Phase 4 (Weeks 19-24):** Polish - Production-grade + job search

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-6)
**Goal:** Build core memory infrastructure that actually works

### Week 1: Semantic Search ✅ (CURRENT)
**Status:** Days 1-3 complete

**Completed:**
- [x] Repository setup
- [x] SimpleMemory class (JSON persistence)
- [x] Basic CLI (store/search/list/stats)

**This Week (Days 4-7):**
- [ ] Add ChromaDB for vector storage
- [ ] Implement embeddings (sentence-transformers)
- [ ] Replace dumb search with semantic search
- [ ] Test: "job" should find "career", "employment", etc.

**Deliverable:** Semantic search that understands meaning, not just keywords

**Tech:** ChromaDB, sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

---

### Week 2: Structured Memory
**Goal:** Add a graph layer for relationships

**Build:**
- SQLite database for structured data
- Tables: entities, relationships, facts
- Connect vector search (ChromaDB) with graph (SQLite)
- Query: "What do I know about X?" pulls both semantic + structured data

**Deliverable:** Hybrid retrieval - vectors + graph together

**Tech:** SQLite, custom graph layer

---

### Week 3: Entity Extraction
**Goal:** Automatically extract important information

**Build:**
- Extract entities from stored memories (people, projects, concepts, dates)
- Store entities in graph database
- Link memories to entities
- Query: "Show me everything related to [person/project]"

**Deliverable:** Automatic knowledge extraction

**Tech:** spaCy or simple regex patterns to start

---

### Week 4: Temporal Awareness
**Goal:** Understand time and context

**Build:**
- Time-based retrieval (recent vs old)
- Context windows (what was I doing last week?)
- Memory decay (weight recent memories higher)
- Timeline view in CLI

**Deliverable:** Time-aware memory retrieval

**Tech:** Custom scoring algorithms, time-series indexing

---

### Week 5: Memory Compression
**Goal:** Handle large amounts of data efficiently

**Build:**
- Summarization of old conversations
- Hierarchical memory (detailed → summary → gist)
- Pruning strategies (what to keep, what to compress)
- Storage optimization

**Deliverable:** Can handle 1000+ memories without slowdown

**Tech:** Transformers for summarization, compression algorithms

---

### Week 6: Phase 1 Polish
**Goal:** Make everything production-ready

**Build:**
- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation (README, docstrings, architecture doc)
- Blog post: "Building a Personal AI Memory System - Phase 1"

**Deliverable:** Rock-solid foundation ready for Phase 2

---

## Phase 2: Intelligence (Weeks 7-12)
**Goal:** Make the system learn and reason

### Week 7: Conversation Memory
- Session management (track conversation threads)
- Context aggregation (what did we talk about today?)
- Multi-turn context preservation

### Week 8: Learning Loop
- Track what works (successful retrievals)
- Track what fails (empty searches)
- Adaptive ranking (learn user preferences)
- Feedback mechanism

### Week 9: Pattern Recognition
- Identify recurring themes
- Detect habits and preferences
- Generate insights ("You often work on X on Mondays")

### Week 10: Reasoning Layer
- Simple inference (if X then probably Y)
- Contradiction detection (you said A, now you said B)
- Knowledge completion (fill in gaps)

### Week 11: Multi-Modal Support
- Support for code snippets
- Support for URLs/web content
- Support for file attachments
- Unified retrieval across types

### Week 12: Phase 2 Polish
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation update
- Blog post: "Teaching AI to Learn From You"

---

## Phase 3: Interface (Weeks 13-18)
**Goal:** Make it usable as a full agent

### Week 13: LLM Integration
- Integrate local LLM (Ollama/llama.cpp)
- Basic agent loop: query → retrieve → respond → store
- Streaming responses

### Week 14: Agent Architecture
- Tool use (memory as a tool)
- Multi-step reasoning
- Error recovery and fallbacks

### Week 15: Advanced CLI
- Interactive mode (chat interface)
- Rich TUI (text user interface)
- Command history and autocomplete

### Week 16: Web API
- FastAPI backend
- RESTful endpoints
- WebSocket for streaming
- Authentication (local only)

### Week 17: Basic Web UI
- Simple frontend (React or vanilla JS)
- Chat interface
- Memory browser
- Timeline view

### Week 18: Phase 3 Polish
- End-to-end testing
- Security audit (local-first security)
- User testing (friends/family)
- Blog post: "Your Personal AI Assistant"

---

## Phase 4: Polish & Job Hunt (Weeks 19-24)
**Goal:** Production-grade system + land the job

### Week 19: Performance Optimization
- Profiling and bottleneck identification
- Caching strategies
- Async operations where needed
- Load testing

### Week 20: Production Features
- Import/export (backup/restore)
- Migration tools
- Configuration management
- Logging and monitoring

### Week 21: Documentation Overhaul

## Weekly Rhythm

**Build (10-15 hours):**
- Code the week's features
- Test as you go
- Commit frequently

**Learn (3-5 hours):**
- Read relevant papers/docs
- Study similar systems
- Learn new techniques

**Share (2 hours):**
- Update JOURNAL.md
- Write technical insights
- Share progress publicly
- Engage with community

**Total: 15-22 hours/week**

---

## Rules of Engagement

1. **Ship every week** - No exceptions. Even if ugly.
2. **Document as you build** - Future you will thank you.
3. **Ask when stuck (30 min rule)** - Try for 30 mins, then ask.
4. **Share publicly** - This is your portfolio in real-time.
5. **No perfectionism** - Done > Perfect.
6. **Use the project daily** - You're your own user #1.

---

## Emergency Protocols

**If you're behind:**
- Cut scope, not quality
- Focus on core functionality
- Skip nice-to-haves
- Communicate (in JOURNAL.md)

**If you're stuck:**
- Start a new Claude chat with context
- Share specific error/question
- Reference this roadmap
- Ask for help in community

**If life happens:**
- You have buffer time built in
- Some weeks can be 10 hours instead of 20
- Momentum matters more than speed
- Just don't stop completely

---

## The North Star

Every decision asks: **"Does this get me closer to a 250k remote job?"**

- Does this demonstrate technical depth? → Build it
- Does this show I can ship? → Build it
- Does this prove I understand systems? → Build it
- Is this just nice-to-have polish? → Skip it (for now)
